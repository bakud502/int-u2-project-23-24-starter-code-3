    <h3>Why are you facing so many problems in life?</h3>
    
    <p>Why do you have so many problems? Trust me, they say it's your fault all the time, but who are they? People that have never worked hard to get money or material success? Do you truly think all the rich people worked super hard to get where they're at? Of course not! They are the ones that created the economy up to their standards and they tell you what to do to keep you in your 9 to 5 forever, barely being able to pay your rent, your food, and barely able to handle all of the stress around you.</p>
      
      <p>You yourself must figure this out first and look at how the world works. The water that drops from a faucet compared to a waterfall, they're the same thing: water dropping for the use of other humans and organisms, but the biggest waterfalls have thousands of gallons of water dropping every second while a faucet takes a minute to even produce a gallon of water.</p> 

     <p> Money works like this to, but like the waterfall and the faucet, you must be at the right place at the right time. Sometimes the waterfall drops more or less water depending on the weather and environmental changes. Unlike the waterfall, the amount of water in a faucet stays the same mostly but is super stable because it drops little water compared to te waterfall</p> 
      
        <p>That's why no matter what, you will always get paid your wage, because it's nothing to the person that's paying you the wage. You are the faucet that gets water provided to it to run, and the waterfall gives some of its water to you but the waterfall doesn't get affected to a noticeable rate.</p>
      
      <p>First you at the very least must identify the problem, and this is the problem: you are facing many of the problems in life because you are in a situation where you can't help yourself. You must seek help from an outside expertise that ca help you overcome stress together. If you suffer, the community suffers for you too.</p>
